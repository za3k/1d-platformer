Written by [Zachary "za3k" Vance](https://za3k.com) as part of Hack-a-Day. [Hack-a-Day](https://za3k.com/hackaday) is a challenge to do one project every day in November.

A simple game-jam style platformer. There is only one button: jump. [Play online](https://za3k.github.io/1d-platformer/) via this link.

This definitely isn't done, but I ran out of time.

Features I want for a future iteration:

- When you hit the spikes, you should die or take damage
- Better spike collisions
- Make every floor have at least one "safe space". Right now you can be screwed by the RNG
- Better scaling. Ex. only introduce spikes on level 50, and make them happen more often over time. Right now the only difficulty control is speed.
- Fade-off to the two sides, so it looks like rotating tower floors
- When you die, have the guy go visually spinning to the bottom
- Maybe you go to the side on the conveyor platformers? Unsure.
- Sounds \(jump, death, BG music\)
